# The Voice Design — Improvement Loop

## Done
- Clipboard and selection actions now work: Duplicate (Cmd+D), Copy (Cmd+C), Cut (Cmd+X), Paste (Cmd+V), Remove (Delete), Select all (Cmd+A).
- Groups and their children are cloned together with remapped parent IDs.
- Layers panel has a Duplicate button next to Group / Ungroup.
- Command palette lists Duplicate, Copy, Cut, and Paste.
- Fit artboard and zoom shortcuts set view intent correctly.
- Layers panel rows now include a compact opacity scrubber for direct per-layer opacity tweaks without leaving the list.
- Opacity scrubber in Layers rows is now hover-only (or always visible when the layer is selected) with a larger hit target for better usability.
- Layers opacity control now includes a clickable percent badge that opens an inline number field for exact percent entry (Enter/Escape), alongside the scrubber.
- Path point inspector now shows Bézier in/out handle offsets (when present) plus Smooth / Corner / Delete actions on every point row.
- Live phosphor dash/offset ghost overlay on the canvas while scrubbing Stroke Dash or Offset in the inspector.
- Live phosphor overlay while scrubbing Stroke Width, and hover/focus/change preview for Cap and Join selects (consistent with dash ghost).
- Live phosphor overlay while scrubbing Stroke Miter Limit, Polygon/Star Sides, and Arrow Head Scale (same ghost system).
- Alt+ArrowUp/Down steps selection opacity by 1% while the Layers panel is focused (clamped 0–100%). Tooltips mention the shortcut.

- Path point inspector now has a Mirror toggle that keeps in/out handles mirrored. Focusing a handle field highlights that arm with a live tangent guide overlay on the canvas.
- Layers panel now shows a Type quick strip (Size + Tracking) whenever text layers are selected. Scrubbers and number fields update live; mixed selections show Mixed and apply to all selected text.

## Iteration
2026-10-24 11:15 BST — Added Type quick strip to Layers panel for selected text: live Size (8–160) and Tracking (−8 to 40) controls with mixed-state handling. Verified typecheck, build, and browser smoke.

## Next recommended
- Live phosphor type rhythm overlay (leading lines or tracking ticks) while scrubbing Size / Tracking / Leading in inspector or Layers.
- Per-layer type size badge in Layers rows (click to edit, like opacity).
